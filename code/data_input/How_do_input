Instructions:

1) Only fn to import is get_input_loader function from input_final file
2) in params folder open choosetc file of your choice of file type to input data from and add names of test cases you want to load, refer to the contents of the files in params
3) First line should be TSPLIB_{file type} TSPLIB_XML for xml file type
4) call get_input_loader with first arg as just name of param file you modified above
4) if you dont want to load(or dont have) opt data then give second arg as False(default is True)
5) make sure u run your code from any dir inside the repo
6) the function returns BaseinputLoader object which you can use to call input data
6) refer to get_{stuff} functions of BaseInputLoader and BaseInput in bass-input.py to use input data

NOTE: For asymmetric, no opt route is available only opt cost is there, for now temp_opt_cost_reader is sufficient

Thank you
